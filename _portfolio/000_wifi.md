Wifi-Safety usually refers to being able to run a mod online while playing with people that are on vanilla. Movesets and collision edits are obviously not wifi-safe, but some random changes to stage elements can cause desyncs. I've found that this often occurs when you use a blank `numatb` or `numdlb` with an object that has materials animated in a motion folder (ie Animal Crossing villagers). There's also several other random instances, like the ufo and pelican on Smashville can't be replaced with different models for whatever reason, and certain effects (like the Town and City bubbles) have their effect locator removed might also cause desyncs. We can never know for sure what causes desyncs, but if you need to "remove" an object, and it has an animation, use a blank `numshb` instead.
