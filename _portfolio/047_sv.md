# Lighting
This stage cycles through 4 different lights which occur at different times than T&C. There's windowlight and sky models that correspond to the time of day, as well as decoration, stage, taxi, and platform lights that only spawn during night. 
# Clock hand
Unlike T&C, the clock hand's position is handled internally. Man I hate brawl stages...
# Villagers
All villagers (with Brewster and a few small exceptions) use animations from the common motion folder to animate. Pretty handy if you want to make custom villagers, but they'll have to be the same skeleton. Here's some things to look out for:
- Niko is a special concert animation for male villagers
- Musu is an enamored animation, kinda like a special version of "clap" that only human villagers use
- Komari is a panicked animation that only villagers use
- Some villagers (ie tortimer) will play animations slightly slower than other villagers
- Guards and KK have unique animations, but these can be found in the common folder
- Brewster's animation is found in his own folder
