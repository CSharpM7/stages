### Changing the layout
Unfortunately, platform positions are hard coded. The good news is you can change the hurtbox position of the platforms, but the platforms themselves will always snap to one location no matter what.
### LVD File
The game will crash if there aren't vertices for each of the damageable platforms, but feel free to put said verticies to -400 or something if you want to "remove" the platform
