# Wrap Effect
`0x172fb2f3df` controls where a player is sent, but does not control where the boundary is. This can be set to a negative number.
# Model Locations
The platforms (yuka) are rendered from the render folder. The take the vertices from the LVD file, which partially explains why there's so many different vertices for a group. Not sure at the moment what controls where the yuka are positioned atm, the skeleton of `main_ground_set` DOES control the POW block's location, however.

Enemies are located in item/st_shell and item/st_crab
