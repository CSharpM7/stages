# Main Mechanic
This stage plays out a lap of Mute City. The Course motion file controls which part of the track is being played. It will select A and B randomly. If the course animation finishes before any other animation (ie flyingplate), then it will proceed to the next part of the course. There's 4 parts, where "s" motion files are for the starting lap, and "l" for every lap after that (it needs an extra ~325 for the initial match countdown). The Blue Falcon and the other racers have extra animations for when the Falcon needs to get hit or a rival car needs to explode.
# Hardcoded Objects
