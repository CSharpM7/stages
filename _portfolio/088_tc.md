# Lighting
This stage cycles through 5 different lights which occur at different times than Smashville. There's windowlight and sky models that correspond to the time of day, as well as decoration, stage, taxi, and platform lights that only spawn during night. 
# Villagers
All villagers use animations from their own dedicated motion folder.
