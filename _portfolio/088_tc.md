# Wifi Safety
For some reason, this stage can cause a desync if certain files are blanked. While not everything is understood, here is what I've found
## Villagers
Can desync if using a blank numatb or numdlb. Use a blank numshb or an invisible xmb instead
## Various Background Elements
Can desync if the models are changed for...whatever reason. These models include the bus

# Lighting
This stage cycles through 5 different lights which occur at different times than Smashville. There's windowlight and sky models that correspond to the time of day, as well as decoration, stage, taxi, and platform lights that only spawn during night. 
# Villagers
All villagers use animations from their own dedicated motion folder.
