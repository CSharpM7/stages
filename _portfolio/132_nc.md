# Background cutscene
Everything from sound effect sequences, to animations, to visibility is controlled by what frame the Camera animation is currently on. This means if your camera animation only has 1 frame, then the background will only loop that one frame, and then reset to the beginning. The visual stdat contains information for when an animation should be played, and when a model should be visible or not.
