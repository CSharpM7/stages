# Main Mechanic
While this is a "touring" stage, unfortunately it does not work at all like Mario Circuit, Northern Cave, Hollow Bastion, etc. The ring AND the camera are actually animated together, which makes creating a custom path a nightmare. The motion file dictates the entire cycle, so you can't slow it down via the stdat. What's worse: there's a weird quirk with the LVD file where if you give a collision more than 2 vertices, it unloads. What a shame, this could have been a really cool stage...
